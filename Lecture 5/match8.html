That's all from us for the moment, this is Ankur Dhawan, signing off on behalf of Deivarayan Muthu and Venkat Raghav.\n\nHere's the <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19322/report/1187681/new-zealand-vs-india-5th-t20i-india-in-new-zealand-2019-20\" target=\"_blank\">full report</a> of another NZ meltdown. Can they turn it around? Sid Monga and Fidel Fernando discuss in the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=28616271\" target=\"_blank\">Stump Mic Podcast.</a>\n\n<strong>Virat Kohli:</strong> All of us are really proud of how we played. It's about finding ways to win. Today, all these young guys were on the field after Rohit's unfortunate injury and them coming together and handling the pressure well is great to see. We need everyone to be the best versions of themselves. These kind of victories give more satisfaction than one-sided wins. Although the scoreline may not reflect, New Zealand is in great hands with Kane Williamson leading them, they are side headed in the right direction.\n\n\n<strong>Tim Southee</strong>: Another close one, unfortunately on the wrong side. Can't give India a sniff.(Looking ahead to the ODIs) Different format, different people come in, it's a format in which we have done well.\n\n<strong>KL Rahul</strong>: is the player of the series: Very pleased, great to be standing here with a five-nil. We have been playing exceptional T20 cricket, to come here and execute our skills every game, to have squeezed out wins, is a confidence booster. Not thinking about T20 World Cup, hopefully I can continue playing this way. I think it's a winning habit we have cultivated. The onus is on finding different ways to win. Rohit's alright, unfortunate injury, hopefully he should be fine in a couple of days. Just relax a little for a couple of days, enjoy a five-nil win that doesn't happen often, rest a little.\n\n<strong>Jasprit Bumrah is the player of the match:</strong>The match got close at one, point but we had belief, that we could squeeze in a couple of tight overs. First time in New Zealand, different ground dimensions, great result.\n\nAn incredible five-nil away from home for India, and that's eight straight T20I wins on the bounce. A spirited bowling performance considering a sub-par total and also the fact that they were without their captain and stand-in captain. Another heart-break for New Zealand and Ross Taylor, who was playing his 100th T20I, but they have only themselves to blame again. He made another fifty, took the game deep but couldn't get them across the line yet again. While he and Tim Seifert were at the crease, New Zealand were crusing, 34 had been taken from an over, but India found a way back again, as they have done repeatedly in the series. Bumrah was excellent, his best performance since return from injury.","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":19.5,"text":"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, length outside off again, it was in  the slot but slightly wider than the ones he deposited into the stands, and for all the drama we've seen so far, nine off one is unlikely to happen","event":0,"commId":"219050","commSeq":201905,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":19.4,"text":"Thakur to Sodhi, <b>SIX</b> runs, it's length again and Sodhi has lined him up for that delivery, swings hard again and makes excellent contact, sails over deep square leg as New Zealand hang in there","event":6,"commId":"219040","commSeq":201904,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":19.3,"text":"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, goes full, yorker just outside off, Sodhi can't get any bat on it","event":0,"commId":"219030","commSeq":201903,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":19.2,"text":"Thakur to Sodhi, <b>SIX</b> runs, length on middle, Sodhi makes room and cracks this high into the night sky and deep onto the grass banks at deep midwicket, that's massive, massive six","event":6,"commId":"219020","commSeq":201902,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":19.1,"text":"Thakur to Sodhi, no run, knuckle ball, outside off, swings too early and misses","event":0,"commId":"219010","commSeq":201901,"dismissalText":"","pre":"","post":"","hasVideoId":false}],"overNo":20,"completed":true,"endOfOver":"20 | 13 Runs | NZ: 156/9","endOfOverRunsReq":"(8 runs required, RR: 7.80)","batsmen":[{"name":"Ish Sodhi","stat":"16 (10b)"},{"name":"Hamish Bennett","stat":"1 (2b)"}],"bowlers":[{"name":"Shardul Thakur","stat":"4-0-38-2"},{"name":"Jasprit Bumrah","stat":"4-1-12-3"}],"hasLastEndOfOver":true}],"href":"/series/19322/commentary/1187681/new-zealand-vs-india-5th-t20i-india-in-new-zealand-2019-20","enabled":true,"scorer":"Venkat Raghav","commentator":"Ankur Dhawan","commentPreText":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:fullcommentary","groundTime":"","currentOver":20},"scorecard":{"innings":{"1":{"title":"India Innings","inningStatus":"","isCurrent":false,"batsmen":[{"name":"KL Rahul","displayName":"KL Rahul","href":"https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/422108.html","captain":false,"roles":"&dagger;","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player","hasVideoId":false,"videoId":28617613,"video":{},"stats":[{"name":"runs","text":"R","value":"45"},{"name":"ballsFaced","text":"B","value":"33"},{"name":"minutes","text":"M","value":"-"},{"name":"fours","text":"4s","value":"4"},{"name":"sixes","text":"6s","value":"2"},{"name":"strikeRate","text":"SR","value":"136.36"}],"isNotOut":false,"commentary":"<strong>leading edge and taken at cover!</strong> It was back of a length and angling in again, Rahul, who wanted to work it leg side, turned the face of the bat a bit early and it just lobbed up to Mitchell Santner for the simplest chance","runningScore":{"wickets":2,"runs":96},"runningOver":{"overs":11.3},"shortText":"c Santner b Bennett"},{"name":"SV Samson","displayName":"Sanju Samson","href":"https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/425943.html","captain":false,"roles":"","trackingName":"&lpos=cricket:game:scorecard:player","hasVideoId":false,"videoId":28617476,"video":{},"stats":[{"name":"runs","text":"R","value":"2"},{"name":"ballsFaced","text":"B","value":"5"},{"name":"minutes","text":"M","value":"-"},{"name":"fours","text":"4s","value":"0"},{"name":"sixes","text":"6s","value":"0"},{"name":"strikeRate","text":"SR","value":"40.00"}],"isNotOut":false,"commentary":"overpitched and wide outside off, asks to be put away to the fence.
