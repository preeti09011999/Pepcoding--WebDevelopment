No taking away from how good New Zealand have been through this series. Sets us up perfectly for the two Tests to follow, I reckon. On behalf of Chandan Duorah and Saurabh Somani, this is Debayan Sen saying goodbye. Thanks for your company, and follow the game with ESPNcricinfo.\n\n<b>Kane Williamson</b>: \"An outstanding performance. Very clinical - India put us under pressure, but the way the guys fought back with the ball and kept them to a par total. The cricket smarts in the second half was outstanding to see. We know how good they are at all formats, but for us the clarity about the roles the guys had was the most important thing. The ODI side will be taking this momentum into the Australia series. Outstanding effort against a brilliant India side. (On his own performance) It's recovering well.\"\n\n<b>Virat Kohli</b>: \"I think the first match, we were pretty much in the contest. All three games, the composure and the way we fielded wasn't good enough for international cricket. The way we came back was a positive for us. In the field, we weren't good enough at all. (On New Zealand) We played really well in the T20 series, here in the ODIs, a couple of new guys, good experience for them. They played with a lot more intensity after the T20 series. They deservedly won 3-0. I think because of the Test Championship, every match has that more importance. We have a really balanced Test team and we feel we can win the series here, but we need to step on to the park with the right kind of mindset.\"\n\n<b>Ross Taylor is the Man of the Series.</b>\n\n<b>Henry Nicholls is the Man of the Match</b>: \"To make it 3-0 was what we wanted to do. To put in a good performance in a chase was good. (Batting with Guptill) The way he started put us in a good position in the run chase. It certainly helps me that he scores so quickly. The idea was to put them under pressure. I could just play second fiddle. We've scored well in the first three matches, and that's good to take into the Test matches.\"\n\nShardul Thakur has the worst economy rate for any India bowler with 10 wickets and in the top 5 worst averages -- only <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=bowling_average;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin2=10;qualval2=wickets;team=6;template=results;type=bowling\" target=\"_blank\">Dinda ahead of him,</a> says Gaurav Sundararaman.\n\n<b>10.43pm</b> Presentation coming up shortly...\n\nNaresh: \"If Shardul completed his quota, he would have scored more than Rahul! #DisappointingTimes! \"\n\nDoc: \"WOW! Blown away by the Kiwi's this series. Nothing but admiration from over here in South Africa. \"\n\n<strong>10.38</strong> And so New Zealand consign India to their first bilateral series whitewash in 31 years -- also the first time in 14 years, that India have failed to win a single game in one. Set up so well by the openers, and finished off in style by Latham and de Grandhomme. India will be most disappointed by yet another underwhelming effort by their bowlers. Probably went a little below par on a belter of a pitch with the score, but the way their bowlers began with the new ball set the tone for what deservedly now looks like an easy chase. Yuzvendra Chahal caused a few flutters with a couple of quick wickets, but New Zealand always looked in control of this.","hasVideoId":false,"video":{},"videoId":28677654}],"overNo":48,"completed":true,"endOfOver":"48 | 4 Runs | NZ: 300/5","endOfOverRunsReq":"| RR: 6.36","batsmen":[{"name":"Colin de Grandhomme","stat":"58 (28b)"},{"name":"Tom Latham","stat":"32 (34b)"}],"bowlers":[{"name":"Shardul Thakur","stat":"9.1-0-87-1"},{"name":"Jasprit Bumrah","stat":"10-0-50-0"}],"hasLastEndOfOver":true},{"comments":[{"timeStamp":46.6,"text":"Bumrah to de Grandhomme, 1 run, length, and he punches this past point.
