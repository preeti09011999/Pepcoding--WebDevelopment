What a debut for him. He's the second New Zealand player to win the match award on ODI debut. Hope you enjoyed the game was much as we did bringing it you. Thanks for reading. On that note, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Al Muthu.\n\n\n<b>Latham</b>: Obviously, a great victory today. Last game the batters won the game, today the bowlers did the job. I think that total was okay, it was a funny wicket. We managed to take wickets upfront and the bowlers kept taking wickets. We've had some close games with India, delighted to get the win. It was just about juggling, Tim was struggling with illness as well. That epitomises the team. Kyle on debut was fantastic. Delighted for him. It'll be great to win 3-nil from here. Fingers crossed, and hopefully we keep learning.\n\n<b>Jamieson, Man of the Match on debut</b>: Bit of a high at the moment. Still kind of sinking it. The game kind of ebbed and flowed. It was pretty simple: we were just trying to get it through 50 overs. Just trying and stick with Ross. Relief was the feeling to get the first wicket out of the way and not give too many runs. International cricket is quite high intensity, but it was pretty cool.\n\n<b>Kohli</b>: Two pretty good games, great for the fans. Particularly impressed how we finished the game. First half we let things slip away. I think Saini and Jadeja showed great character, as I said one-day cricket in this calendar year is not as relevant like T20Is and Tests. A game where we could have taken chances and capitalised. We could definitely consider changes, we have nothing to lose now. No messages were sent to Jadeja or Saini. We didn't know Saini can be as good with the bat. We want guys to figure out situations themselves.\n\n<b>11.02pm</b> Another thriller at Eden Park, and the seamers have tipped it NZ's way. Jadeja and the tail gave the hosts a scare, but NZ have survived it to sew up the series, after having been swept 5-0 in the preceding T20I series. Jadeja did a Dhoni: rallied the lower order and (nearly) reduced the game into a one-on-one shootout, but Neesham and de Grandhomme managed to shut him down. Credit to Jamieson, the debutant, and Southee for making early inroads with the new ball. Do stick with us for the presentation. <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/19322/report/1187683/new-zealand-vs-india-2nd-odi-india-in-new-zealand-2019-20\" target=\"_blank\">Alagappan Muthu's report</a> will tell you the full story of the day.\n\n\n\n\nBaandhava : \"This match reminded me of world cup semifinal. Everyone were hopeless and suddenly Jadeja will bring back India in to the game but finally succumbs to required run rate pressure.\"\n\nSameer: \"Cricket is a great leveller. In T20s Ross Taylor was the main culrpit for NZ. But in ODIs he is the main hero here as he bailed NZ out from nowhere to win the match. Great stuff.
